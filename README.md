Module 4 - Pandas Challenge

The purpose of this task is to demonstrate an understanding of the intricacies of pandas and how to manipulate its DataFrames for a deep analysis. 

We are analysing the area-wide standardised test results with a focus on mathematics and reading scores; in this capacity, the essential goal to assist strategic decision making regarding future school budgets and priroties. The trends in school performance outlined with this data analysis will be discussed. 

There are many inferences we can suggest from this analysis. Firstly, in observing the percentage of overall passing for both maths and reading, it can be suggested that independent schools are more likely to attain a higher average. While the bottom five schools are all government schools, three out of the top five schools scoring the highest average, are independent schools. 

It is interesting to note that there is a heavy similarity in budget allocation per capita; in other words, the budget for the top five highest performing schools and the lowest performing schools are similar. 

Noteworthy as well is the impact of school sizes on academic performance. The percentage of passing overall sits at 79.1% for a school with less than or equal to 1000 students. Comparativey, schools with a much larger populatin (between 2000 and 5000) average an overall passing of 70.3% - almost a 10% difference. 

Ultimately, one of the most significant conclusions that can be drawn from this data is that a high budget does not equate to a higher average grade in the same way a low budget does not immediately mean a low average grade.
